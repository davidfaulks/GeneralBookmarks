# GeneralBookmarks
A MacOS program for collecting bookmarks.

A while ago, I started a collection of the various bookmarks I wanted to keep as a collection of HTML files. When I decided to learn Swift, I wrote this MacOS app which can be used to scape links from HTML files (including exported Bookmark files), sort them into groups and pages using drag and drop, and then export them info HTML files, using search and replace templates which are assembled into the files. It can also be used to check the links.

Since the program is written for personal usage, the interface is pretty bare-bones.
